# Claude Code Instructions

All glory to our Father in Heaven, and His Son Jesus Christ, which paid for our sins and defeated evil forever, and asked our Father in Heaven to send us the Holy Spirit, which make one God, Amin.

We love Jesus Christ, which is the Son of our Father in Heaven, which is God, Amin.

Write modular code for all functionality and components. Separate every functionality and component into modules in separate files.

Always use context engine and context tools before coding, to understand the code fully before changing or adding code.

Never specify year when searching the web, only when specifically asked to by the user.

Always code functions, components, and modules for concurrent execution by default.

Every response, logic, code, architecture, and solution must be guided through the Holy Spirit through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ which is the Son of our Father in Heaven, Amin.

When coding, check if dependencies exist that do the desired functionality, if yes, then use the dependency.

When the user tells you about a bug or issue, fix the core issue.

Dont use emoticons in code or logs or comments in the code.

Add comments, info and documentation in the code.

Never add any emojis in the code.

Never instruct the user to restart the server, frontend, or any processes. The user always handles restarts themselves.

Do not create any documentation files, create them only if you ai are told to.

To gather documentation of dependencies used in the code, use context7 and web searching tools.

Do not add any fallback mechanisms, default values, or graceful degradation. All failures must result in explicit errors being thrown. Code either works completely or fails with errors.

Reuse components by making them configurable through propierties and conditional rendering instead of creating similar components.

Code mathematically, so all functions and components work based on math.

We are in the year 2025.

**BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGE, YOU MUST CALL THE CONTEXT ENGINE (codebase-retrieval tool).**

This is the single most important instruction. Every time you are about to:
- Write new code
- Modify existing code
- Fix a bug
- Add a feature
- Refactor code
- Change any file in any way

You MUST first call the context engine (codebase-retrieval) to understand:
1. The exact code flow and architecture
2. Where exactly to make changes
3. What functions, classes, and modules are involved
4. How the existing code works
5. What dependencies and imports are used
6. The patterns and conventions in the codebase

DO NOT blindly search through files and waste your context window. The context engine gives you PRECISE, TARGETED information about exactly what you need. It knows the codebase. Trust it.

**The workflow is:**
1. User asks for a code change
2. IMMEDIATELY call codebase-retrieval with a detailed query about what you need to know
3. Read and understand the context provided
4. THEN and ONLY THEN start making code changes

If you skip this step, you will:
- Waste context window searching randomly
- Miss important code patterns
- Make incorrect assumptions
- Create bugs because you did not understand the code flow

**Be wise about when to use it:** The context engine knows everything about the codebase - how code flows, what connects to what, and where things belong. But it takes time. If a task requires no understanding of code relationships - just reading a file, checking a value, or finding something you ai can locate directly - handle it.
