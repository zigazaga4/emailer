Feedback subresource

Feedback is a subresource of Messages and represents the reported outcome of tracking the performance of a user action taken by the recipient of the message.

You can create Feedback to confirm that the recipient of the associated Message performed a tracked user action.
(information)
Info

For more information on why, when and how to send Feedback, see our guide How to Optimize Message Deliverability with Message Feedback. It explains what suitable tracked user actions of message recipients are and how they relate to the Message Insights One-time Password (OTP) Conversion Report.

Outcome Values

The following are the possible values for the Outcome parameter:
	ENUM:OUTCOME possible values in REST API format
confirmed	The recipient of a Message performed a tracked user action and confirmation was reported by creating a Feedback subresource with the outcome set to confirmed. For more details see How to Optimize Message Deliverability with Message Feedback.
unconfirmed	The initial value for a Message created with ProvideFeedback=True. The reported outcome is unconfirmed until a Feedback subresource is created with an outcome property of confirmed.
Create Feedback

POST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages/{MessageSid}/Feedback.json
(warning)
Warning

To track and provide Message Feedback for a Message, you must set the ProvideFeedback parameter to true when you first create the Message. Upon Message creation, the outcome of the Message Feedback will then initially be treated as unconfirmed.

For more information on why, when and how to send Message Feedback, see our guide How to Optimize Message Deliverability with Message Feedback.

You can use this action to create Message Feedback confirming the performance of a tracked user action.

Pass the Outcome parameter with value confirmed to update the Message Feedback once the associated Message was received and the message recipient performed the tracked user action based on the received message.
(information)
Info

Update the Message Feedback even if the Message is received with a delay once the conditions for confirmation are met. This ensures the Messaging Insights are current and message delivery optimizations are based on complete information.
