Media subresource

Media is a subresource of Messages and represents a piece of media, such as an image, that is associated with a Message.

Twilio creates a Media subresource and stores the contents of the media when the following events occur:

    You send an MMS with an image via Twilio.
    You send a WhatsApp message with an image via Twilio.
    You receive media in a message sent to one of your Twilio numbers or messaging channel addresses.

Twilio retains the stored media until you delete the related Media subresource instance.

To secure access to media stored on Twilio, you can enable HTTP basic authentication in the Console settings for Programmable Messaging

.
(warning)
Warning

Messages sent via Twilio can include up to 10 media files that have a total size of up to 5MB. Twilio resizes images as necessary for successful delivery based on carrier specifications. Messages with over 5MB of media will not be accepted.

Retrieve Media

GET https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages/{MessageSid}/Media/{Sid}.json

Returns a single Media subresource using one of several representations:

    content-type
    XML
    JSON

Default: content-type

Without an extension, the media is returned using the mime-type provided when the media was generated.

GET /2010-04-01/Accounts/AC.../Message/MM.../Media/ME557ce644e5ab84fa21cc21112e22c485

Alternative: XML

Appending ".xml" to the URI returns a familiar XML representation. For example:

GET /2010-04-01/Accounts/AC.../Message/MM.../Media/ME557ce644e5ab84fa21cc21112e22c485.xml

(information)
Info

Because the stored media URLs are useful for many external applications, they are public and do not require HTTP Basic Auth to access. This allows you to embed the URL in a web application without revealing your Twilio API credentials.

If you have a need to restrict access to media stored with Twilio, you can enable HTTP Auth in the Console settings. When you fetch your Message Media after enabling HTTP auth, you will be directed to a signed URL that is only valid for 4 hours.

You can make subsequent API requests for new short-lived URLs for your media at any time.

Hints and Advanced Uses

    Twilio attempts to cache the media file the first time it is used. This may add a slight delay in sending the message.
    Twilio caches files when HTTP headers allow it (via ETag and Last-Modified headers). Responding with Cache-Control: no-cache ensures Twilio always checks if the file has changed, allowing your web server to respond with a new version or with a 304 Not Modified to instruct Twilio to use its cached version.
