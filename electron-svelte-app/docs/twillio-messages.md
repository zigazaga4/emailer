Messages resource

A Message resource represents an inbound or outbound message. Twilio creates a Message when any of the following occur:

    You create a Message resource (i.e., send an outbound message) via the REST API
    Twilio executes a <Message> TwiML instruction
    Someone sends a message to one of your Twilio numbers or messaging channel addresses

With the Messages resource, you can:

    Create new messages (i.e., send outbound messages)
    Fetch a specific message
    Read a list of messages
    Update or redact the content of an existing message
    Delete messages from your account

If you're using Messaging Services, you can also use the Messages resource to:

    Schedule a message
    Create a message with a shortened link

A Message resource can also have a Media sub-resource and/or a MessageFeedback sub-resource.

Message Status values

The table below lists possible values of a Message resource's Status. As messages can be either outbound or inbound, each status description explicitly indicates to which message direction the status applies.
	ENUM:STATUS possible values in REST API format
'queued'	The API request to send an outbound message was successful and the message is queued to be sent out by a specific From sender. For messages sent without a Messaging Service this is the initial Status value of the Message resource.
'sending'	Twilio is in the process of dispatching the outbound message to the nearest upstream carrier in the network.
'sent'	The nearest upstream carrier accepted the outbound message.
'failed'	The outbound message failed to send. This can happen for various reasons including queue overflows, Account suspensions and media errors.
'delivered'	Twilio has received confirmation of outbound message delivery from the upstream carrier, and, where available, the destination handset.
'undelivered'	Twilio received a delivery receipt indicating that the outbound message was not delivered. This can happen for many reasons including carrier content filtering and the availability of the destination handset.
'receiving'	The inbound message was received by Twilio and is currently being processed.
'received'	The inbound message was received and processing is complete.
'accepted'	[Messaging Service only] Twilio has received your API request to immediately send an outbound message with a Messaging Service. If you did not provide a specific From sender in the service's Sender Pool to use, the service is dynamically selecting a From sender. For unscheduled messages to be sent with a Messaging Service, this is the initial Status value of the Message resource.
'scheduled'	[Messaging Service only] The Message resource is scheduled to be sent with a Messaging Service. If you schedule a message with a Messaging Service, this is the initial Status value of the Message resource.
'read'	Channels supported: RCS and WhatsApp. The recipient opened the outbound message. Recipient must have read receipts enabled.
'partially_delivered'	[Deprecated]
'canceled'	[Messaging Service only] The message scheduled with a Messaging Service has been canceled.
NumSegments property

The NumSegments property is relevant for SMS messages only.

For outbound SMS messages, this property indicates the number of SMS messages it took to deliver the body of the message.

If the body of a message is more than 160 GSM-7 characters (or 70 UCS-2 characters), Twilio segments and annotates your messages to attempt proper reassembly on the recipient's handset (not supported by all carriers and handsets). This ensures your body text transmits with the highest fidelity.

On inbound SMS messages, this property indicates the number of SMS messages that make up the message received.

If the body of a message is more than 160 GSM-7 characters (or 70 UCS-2 characters), Twilio attempts to reassemble the message received by your Twilio phone number. All carriers and handsets do not necessarily support this.

Your account is charged for each segment sent or received.

Learn more on the SMS Character Limit Glossary page.
Create a Message resource

POST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages.json

To send a new outgoing message, send an HTTP POST request to your Account's Messages list resource URI.
(warning)
Warning

If you want to send messages while in trial mode, you must first verify your 'To' phone number with Twilio
. You can verify your phone number by adding it to your Verified Caller IDs

in the Console.
(warning)
Warning

Twilio queues messages for delivery at your prescribed rate limit
. API requests for messages that exceed the specified rates

will be queued and executed as capacity is available.

If you need to enqueue a large number of messages, you may want to use Messaging Services.

Every request to create a new Message resource requires a recipient, a sender, and content.

A recipient is specified via the To parameter.

The sender is specified via one of the following parameters:

    From
    MessagingServiceSid

The message content is specified via one of the following parameters:

    MediaUrl
    Body
    ContentSid

Twilio's request to the StatusCallback URL

Whenever a Message resource's Status changes, Twilio sends a POST request to the Message resource's StatusCallback URL.

In a status callback request, Twilio provides a subset of the standard request properties, and additionally MessageStatus and ErrorCode. These properties are described in the table below.
Property	Description
MessageStatus	The status of the Message resource at the time the status callback request was sent.
ErrorCode	If an error occurred (i.e. the MessageStatus is failed or undelivered), this property provides additional information about the failure.
(warning)
Warning

The properties included in Twilio's request to the StatusCallback URL vary by messaging channel and event type and are subject to change.

Twilio occasionally adds new properties without advance notice.

When integrating with status callback requests, it is important that your implementation is able to accept and correctly run signature validation on an evolving set of parameters.

Twilio strongly recommends using the signature validation methods provided in the SDKs and not implementing your own signature validation.

Learn more about status callbacks:

    Outbound Message Status in Status Callbacks
    Track the Message Status of Outbound Messages

SMS/MMS

For most SMS/MMS Messages that have a Status of delivered or undelivered, Twilio's request to the StatusCallback URL contains an additional property:
Property	Description
RawDlrDoneDate	This property is a passthrough of the Done Date included in the DLR (Delivery Receipt) that Twilio received from the carrier.

The value is in YYMMDDhhmm format.

    YY is last two digits of the year (00-99)
    MM is the two-digit month (01-12)
    DD is the two-digit day (01-31)
    hh is the two-digit hour (00-23)
    mm is the two-digit minute (00-59).

Learn more on the "Addition of RawDlrDoneDate to Delivered and Undelivered Status Webhooks" Changelog page
.
WhatsApp and other messaging channels

If the Message resource uses RCS, WhatsApp, or another messaging channel, Twilio's request to the StatusCallback URL contains additional properties. These properties are listed in the table below.
Property	Description
ChannelInstallSid	The Installed Channel SID that was used to send this message
ChannelStatusMessage	The error message returned by the underlying messaging channel if Message delivery failed. This property is present only if the Message delivery failed.
ChannelPrefix	The channel-specific prefix identifying the messaging channel associated with this Message
EventType	This property contains information about post-delivery events. If the channel supports read receipts (currently RCS and WhatsApp), this property's value is READ after the recipient has read the message.
Send an SMS message

The example below shows how to create a Message resource with an SMS recipient.

Sending this POST request causes Twilio to send a text message from +15557122661 (a Twilio phone number belonging to the Account sending the request) to +15558675310. The content of the text message is Hi there.

Send an RCS message
After completing the setup and configuration steps in the Programmable Messaging RCS Onboarding Guide , you can send a Rich Communication Services (RCS) message by creating a new Message resource. Set the MessageServiceSid or From parameter to the SID of the Messaging Service associated with your RCS Sender. To find your Messaging Service's SID, check the Sid column on the Messaging Services page

in the Console.

Programmable Messaging proactively checks if the recipient's device can support RCS, and will send the message using SMS as a fallback if needed.

Send a WhatsApp message

If you have a Twilio-approved WhatsApp sender, you can send WhatsApp messages by creating a new Message resource. (WhatsApp session limitations apply.)

The From parameter value must be your approved WhatsApp sender address (e.g., whatsapp:+15552221111).

The To parameter value must be a WhatsApp recipient address (e.g., whatsapp:+15553334444).

You must also provide message content via the Body and/or MediaUrl parameters.

If you're using Messaging Services with Content API/Content Editor, you can provide message content via the contentSid and contentVariables parameters.

Note: WhatsApp does not support including a text body in the same message as a video, audio file, document, contact (vCard), or location. If you pass the Body parameter on a message with one of these media types, the body is ignored and not delivered to the recipient.

Send a message with a Messaging Service

When sending a message with a Messaging Service, you must provide a recipient via the To parameter and content via the Body, ContentSid, or MediaUrl parameters. In addition, you must provide the MessagingServiceSid.

If you provide a MessagingServiceSid and no From parameter, Twilio determines the optimal From value from your Sender Pool. In this case, the Message resource's initial Status value is accepted.

Optionally, you can provide a MessagingServiceSid and a From parameter. The From parameter must be a sender from your Messaging Service's Sender Pool. In this case, the Message resource's initial Status value is queued.

With Messaging Services, you can also schedule messages to be sent in the future and send messages with shortened links.

Read multiple Message resources

GET https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages.json

Read multiple Message resources by sending a GET request to your Account's Messages list URI.

Results are sorted by the DateSent field, with the most recent messages appearing first.
(warning)
Warning

If you are using the Twilio REST API and plan on requesting more records than will fit on a single page, you may want to use the response's nextpageuri property. Requesting this URI ensures that your next request picks up where it left off and can prevent you from retrieving duplicate data if you are actively sending or receiving messages.

This is not necessary if you are using one of the SDKs, which automatically handle pagination. Take a look at the SDK documentation for more information.

You can also filter the Messages list by providing the following query string parameters to the listing resource:
Path parameters
Property nameTypeRequiredPIIDescription
accountSidSID<AC>
required
Not PII

The SID of the Account associated with the Message resources.
Pattern:
^AC[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$
Min length:
34
Max length:
34
Query parameters
Property nameTypeRequiredPIIDescription
tostring<phone-number>

Optional
PII MTL: 120 days

Filter by recipient. For example: Set this to parameter to +15558881111 to retrieve a list of Message resources with to properties of +15558881111
fromstring<phone-number>

Optional
PII MTL: 120 days

Filter by sender. For example: Set this from parameter to +15552229999 to retrieve a list of Message resources with from properties of +15552229999
dateSentstring<date-time>

Optional
Not PII

Filter by Message sent_date. Accepts GMT dates in the following formats: YYYY-MM-DD (to find Messages with a specific sent_date), <=YYYY-MM-DD (to find Messages with sent_dates on and before a specific date), and >=YYYY-MM-DD (to find Messages with sent_dates on and after a specific date).
dateSentBeforestring<date-time>

Optional

Delete a Message resource

DELETE https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages/{Sid}.json

To delete a Message resource, send a DELETE request to the Message resource's URI.

If the DELETE request is successful, Twilio's response status code is HTTP 204 (No Content).

A deleted Message resource no longer appears in your Account's Messaging logs. Deleted messages cannot be recovered.

Deleting a Message resource also deletes any associated Media and/or MessageFeedback sub-resources. Any associated media file is also deleted unless the same media file is associated with another Message resource in your Account. For example, if you send 1,000 messages with the same media file (e.g., a .jpeg file), that media file remains accessible until all 1,000 associated Message resources (and/or the associated Media sub-resources) are deleted.
(warning)
Warning

Message bodies may persist for up to 30 days after an HTTP DELETE request in our database backups.
